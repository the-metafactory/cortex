/**
 * MC-I1.S4/S6 (ADR-0005 §4) — the bus→MC projection renderer.
 *
 * §4 makes the bus→MC seam a registered surface-router renderer: a push-based
 * `render(envelope)` rather than the polled DashboardRenderer ring buffer (§4
 * demotes that to, at most, the drill-down's recent-raw-envelopes feed). cortex.ts
 * registers this adapter with the surface-router when `mc.enabled`.
 *
 * The adapter is a single `project(envelope, subject)` dispatcher keyed on
 * `envelope.type`. S4 shipped the `dispatch.task.*` case; **S6 (#848) generalises
 * the seam** to four more families — extending the dispatcher (adding cases),
 * NOT rewriting the renderer, so the surface-router registration and the
 * non-throwing contract stay intact:
 *
 *   | envelope.type                       | handler                          |
 *   |-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
 *   | `dispatch.task.{started,…}`         | projectDispatchLifecycle (S4)    |
 *   | `review.verdict.{approved,…}`       | projectReviewVerdict             |
 *   | `system.agent.heartbeat`            | projectHeartbeat                 |
 *   | `system.attention.{opened,resolved}`| projectAttention (FEDERATED only)|
 *   | `system.adapter.{degraded,…}`       | projectAdapterLifecycle          |
 *
 * ## Non-throwing contract
 *
 * The surface-router wraps every `render()` in a timeout + `Promise.allSettled`
 * (`renderWithIsolation`), but the Renderer contract (renderers/types.ts §2)
 * ALSO obliges the renderer itself to never throw — a projection error must
 * not poison the dispatch loop. We catch inside `render()` and route failures to
 * stderr, mirroring the DashboardRenderer + ingestor error posture.
 *
 * ## WS push (S6 — closes the S4-documented gap)
 *
 * The MC server's WebSocket broadcasts on state transitions via a
 * `WsClientRegistry`. S4's projection writes bypassed that fan-out, so a
 * freshly-projected change wouldn't push to live dashboard clients until their
 * next poll. S6 threads the embed's `wsRegistry` into the renderer
 * (`createProjectionRenderer(db, wsRegistry)`); each projected mutation now
 * emits an `mc.projection` refresh signal via {@link broadcastProjection},
 * reusing the existing broadcast helper rather than inventing a parallel
 * protocol. `wsRegistry` is optional — headless/test wiring passes none and the
 * broadcast is a no-op.
