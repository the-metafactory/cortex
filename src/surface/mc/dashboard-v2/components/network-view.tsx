/**
 * G-1114.D.1 — Network graph view (React Flow + ELK).
 *
 * Replaces the simple agents PANEL (the G-1114.B.4 `NetworkPreviewView`) with a
 * laid-out topology graph: the stack as a hub, every agent as a node fanned
 * around it (radial ELK layout). Same data source — `useAgents` → `/api/agents`
 * + the `agent.presence` WS frame — so the graph pops agents in on boot and
 * drops them off when they go offline, live.
 *
 * ## Code-split (PR #905 review)
 *
 * This module stays in the MAIN bundle: it's the chrome (heading + subtitle +
 * empty/loading/error states) plus the PURE `buildNetworkGraph` adapter — all
 * tiny and engine-free. The heavy half — `@xyflow/react` + `elkjs` (the
 * GWT-compiled ELK engine, +0.62 MB gzip) + the async layout effect — lives in
 * `./network-canvas`, which this view `React.lazy`-imports so the engine chunk
 * downloads ONLY when the principal first opens the Network tab. The dashboard's
 * default view is the working grid, so the common load path never pays for the
 * graph engine. This is the dashboard's first code-split.
 *
 * ## State precedence
 *
 * The empty / loading / error states are chosen by the SAME `pickAgentsPanelMode`
 * the panel used, and they render WITHOUT the lazy canvas — so they stay
 * server-renderable and the heavy chunk only loads when there are agents.
 *
 * ADR-0007: nodes carry presence + lifecycle only — never session interiors.
