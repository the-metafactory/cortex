/**
 * G-1100.B / IAW Phase A.2/A.5: Myelin envelope validator.
 *
 * Validates inbound envelopes against the vendored myelin schema. The
 * schema is copied verbatim from `~/Developer/myelin/schemas/envelope.schema.json`
 * pinned at commit b69c877 (myelin main, post-myelin#113 namespace `{stack}`
 * grammar + myelin#115 shared subjects-derivation surface, on top of the
 * 4578ae1 baseline — F-021 task envelope + MY-400 chain-of-stamps + F-15
 * economics + F-5 sovereignty + F-10 bidding + F-11 capability discovery +
 * F-019/F-020 task subjects).
 *
 * Per docs/design-collaboration-surface.md §9 coupling rules (as refreshed
 * in this PR), the *schema* travels with cortex by value — never imported
 * at runtime — so a myelin outage cannot wedge cortex's validator. The
 * pure-string subject-grammar primitives at `@the-metafactory/myelin/subjects`
 * (myelin#115) carry zero transitive dependencies (no envelope schema, no
 * Ajv, no NATS) and were explicitly designed for ecosystem consumers like
 * cortex to import — §9 now permits this category of import. As a result
 * `deriveNatsSubject` and `validateSubjectEnvelopeAlignment` are thin
 * shims over those primitives instead of cortex-side ports, closing the
 * grammar-extension fan-out problem (every consumer re-porting on each
 * spec bump) at the source. Behavior-pinning tests in
 * `__tests__/envelope-validator.test.ts` lock cortex's expected alignment
 * semantics so any future myelin behavior drift (case-folding, partial
 * matching, etc.) fails fast at vendor-bump time.
 *
 * To upgrade the schema: copy the file, update the `SCHEMA_SOURCE_COMMIT`
 * constant, bump the `@the-metafactory/myelin` pin in package.json to match,
 * extend the vendored types below, run the tests, ship a PR. There is no
 * auto-sync.
 *
 * **IAW Phase A.5 bump (from commit 4578ae1 → b69c877):**
 *
 * - Schema unchanged on the wire — myelin#113/#115 added subject-grammar
 *   surface area without altering envelope JSON Schema.
 * - `deriveNatsSubject(envelope, stack?)` now accepts an optional `stack`
 *   segment, emitting the 6-segment `{prefix}.{principal}.{stack}.{type}` form
 *   when supplied (myelin#113 — IAW Phase A.5). Omitting `stack` preserves
 *   the legacy 5-segment shape; subscribers default-derive missing stack
 *   to `default` per `specs/namespace.md` § Backward compatibility.
 * - Cortex's previous IAW A.3 ports of `deriveNatsSubject` and
 *   `validateSubjectEnvelopeAlignment` (5-segment only) are deleted in
 *   favour of shims around `@the-metafactory/myelin/subjects`.
 *
 * **IAW Phase A.2 baseline (96b14ea → 4578ae1):**
 *
 *   - `signed_by` accepts a single stamp OR a chain (`SignedBy[]`) per
 *     myelin#31. `getSignedByChain()` normalises both shapes into an array.
 *   - `requirements`, `sovereignty_required`, `deadline`,
 *     `distribution_mode`, `target_assistant` per F-021 (the field was
 *     `target_principal` at the A.2 baseline; renamed R13 / myelin#184).
 *   - `economics` upgraded to F-15 typed shape (`budget` / `actual` /
 *     `wallet` / `billing_ref` / `currency`), still optional and not
 *     security-bearing per myelin architecture.md §5.2.
 *   - Stamps may carry an optional semantic `role` (`origin` / `transit` /
 *     `accountability` / `sovereignty` / `notary`) per myelin#31.
