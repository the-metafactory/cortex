/**
 * `surface-principal-gate.ts` — the Bot Packs B-2 surface gate
 * (`docs/design-bot-packs.md` §5, §7, §8; pulse#47 lesson).
 *
 * This is the bridge that finally makes `ask_principal` REAL. B-1 shipped only
 * {@link DenyAllPrincipalGate} (fail-closed) because there was no live surface to
 * render a gate to and no host-side principal check. B-2 adds the surface gate:
 * when a brain task's `response_routing` names a LIVE surface the cortex instance
 * hosts, this gate:
 *
 *   1. RENDERS the gate prompt to the task's surface/thread via the
 *      dispatch-sink/post path (a `dispatch.task.post` envelope — the SAME path
 *      a brain `post` rides; §5 property 1: the brain cannot choose the channel,
 *      the host-supplied routing does);
 *   2. AWAITS a reply from the CONFIGURED PRINCIPAL — resolved by IDENTITY
 *      (platform user id: `principal.mattermostId` / `discordId` / `slackId`),
 *      NEVER by message-text inference. This is the pulse#47 lesson made
 *      structural: "any channel member could say 'run it'" is impossible here
 *      because a reply from anyone but the configured principal id is IGNORED;
 *   3. MAPS the principal's reply to the gate vocabulary (`pass` / `fail`) and
 *      returns the HOST-RESOLVED principal id on the verdict (so the brain
 *      receives an authoritative principal, never a chat-inferred one);
 *   4. TIMES OUT to `fail` — a gate with no principal reply within the window is
 *      denied, fail-closed.
 *
 * ## What is host-real vs. what is the injected seam
 *
 * The IDENTITY CHECK, the pass/fail mapping, the timeout, the host-resolved
 * principal, and the prompt RENDER are all fully implemented here. The one
 * deliberately-injected seam is {@link PrincipalReplySource} — how a live
 * principal reply in a thread is OBSERVED. Wiring that to the live adapter
 * inbound (a DM/@mention correlated back to the open gate) is the deepest part
 * of the adapter integration; isolating it behind a typed source keeps this
 * gate's decision logic — the security-bearing part — fully tested with a stub,
 * and lets the live inbound bridge land without touching the decision logic.
 *
 * ## Fail-closed routing
 *
 * A BUS-ONLY task (no live surface in `response_routing`, or the named surface
 * is not one this instance hosts) NEVER reaches the await — it returns
 * {@link DenyAllPrincipalGate}'s `fail` verbatim. Only a task whose routing
 * names a live, hosted surface AND a configured principal identity gets a real
 * gate. Everything else is denied. (§8: policy stays in cortex; the brain's own
 * claim is never trusted.)
