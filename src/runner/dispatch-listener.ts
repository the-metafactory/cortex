/**
 * MIG-4.5 — Runner subscribes to `dispatch.task.received` via the surface-router.
 *
 * Architectural pattern (G-1111 §5):
 *   The surface-router fans envelopes to N adapters. Adapters declare
 *   interest with subjects + filter and a `render(envelope)` method.
 *   Adapters typically render to platforms (Discord, Mattermost, ...);
 *   the runner reuses the SAME adapter shape but `render()` *dispatches
 *   to a substrate harness* instead. The router doesn't care — it just
 *   fans envelopes. This keeps the runner symmetric with platform
 *   adapters and means a future test harness can register a no-op
 *   runner adapter to drain the bus during integration tests.
 *
 * Lifecycle (per plan-cortex-migration.md §4.5–4.6, IAW Phase A.1b):
 *   1. Envelope arrives on `local.{org}.dispatch.task.received`.
 *   2. Listener parses payload → builds a `DispatchRequest`.
 *   3. Listener instantiates a per-dispatch `ClaudeCodeHarness` and
 *      iterates `harness.dispatch(req)`.
 *   4. For each yielded `MyelinEnvelope` (started / completed / failed
 *      / aborted), the listener calls `runtime.publish(envelope)` to
 *      re-emit it on the bus.
 *   5. The harness's contract guarantees: at least one terminal envelope
 *      (`completed` | `failed` | `aborted`) per dispatch, in order, on
 *      the same `correlation_id`.
 *
 * **A.1b refactor history (cortex#113 / IAW Phase A).** Before A.1b the
 * listener spawned `CCSession` directly and built lifecycle envelopes
 * inline. Now the listener owns *just* the envelope-to-request
 * translation and the publish loop; everything CC-specific lives in
 * `ClaudeCodeHarness`. The behavioural surface is unchanged — the same
 * four envelope types fire in the same order on the same subjects with
 * the same payloads — but the runner is now substrate-agnostic at the
 * code level. A future `BusPeerHarness` slots in by switching which
 * harness the listener constructs per dispatch.
 *
 * **Boundaries (per task contract):**
 *   - This file does NOT modify `dispatch-handler.ts`. The bus-driven path
 *     and the legacy direct-call path coexist until MIG-7.1 picks the
 *     entrypoint wiring.
 *   - This file does NOT modify `cc-session.ts` or `session-manager.ts`.
 *     The harness still wraps `CCSession` underneath; this file no
 *     longer imports it.
 *   - This file does NOT post to Discord. Surfaces (worklog-manager via
 *     §4.7, dashboard via the bus) consume the lifecycle envelopes the
 *     runner emits and render their own way.
 *
 * **Why the listener is a SurfaceAdapter and not a separate "runner
 * subscriber" type:**
 *   The G-1111 design is explicit (§5.1): the surface-router is the single
 *   fan-out point, and adapters declare a `render(envelope)` shape. The
 *   runner is logically *also* a surface — it "renders" envelopes by
 *   dispatching to a substrate. Re-using the same shape keeps the router
 *   code path uniform (subject match → filter → render) and avoids
 *   inventing a parallel "consumer" registry. The semantic difference
 *   (render vs dispatch) lives in the adapter implementation, not the
 *   registry.
