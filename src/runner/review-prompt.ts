/**
 * Build the CC-session review prompt (cortex#911).
 *
 * The dispatch prompt used to be bare intent (`Review PR owner/repo#N`) on the
 * theory that the reviewer's persona owns HOW — routing to a CodeReview skill
 * that posts via `gh pr review` and emits the cortex#237 structured verdict
 * block. In practice a thin persona (e.g. sage's) does neither: it reviews in
 * prose and ends "Shall I post this review?" — so the pipeline's
 * `extractVerdictBlock` finds no block (→ `dispatch.task.completed`, no
 * verdict) and nothing reaches the forge.
 *
 * This builder makes the contract explicit in the prompt itself rather than
 * relying solely on persona routing:
 *   1. ALWAYS instruct the terminal fenced ```json verdict block (the pipeline
 *      parses the LAST such block — `extractVerdictBlock` / `parseVerdictBlock`).
 *      The embedded example is VALID JSON (a concrete sample) — the allowed
 *      enum values are stated in prose OUTSIDE the block so a model copying the
 *      "exact shape" can never emit a type-union literal that fails `JSON.parse`.
 *   2. When `payload.post` is set, instruct a non-interactive `gh pr review`
 *      post (— never "ask first") and report the resulting review id/url back
 *      in the block. Otherwise instruct NOT to post (link-less block).
 *
 * Prompt text raises the floor on persona quality; it does not guarantee model
 * compliance. Failure modes are asymmetric: the VERDICT side fails closed (a
 * missing / malformed block → no `review.verdict.*`, only
 * `dispatch.task.completed`), but the POST side does NOT — when `payload.post`
 * is set the reviewer is told to `gh pr review` before emitting the block, so a
 * forge review can persist even if the block is then absent. That's an
 * accepted property (a posted review is recoverable; a dropped verdict is
 * retryable), not a closed failure mode on the forge.
 *
 * Pure + deterministic — unit-tested in `review-prompt.test.ts`.
