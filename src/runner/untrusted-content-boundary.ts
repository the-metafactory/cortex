/**
 * CO-7 M1 (epic cortex#939) — the **untrusted-content boundary** for a
 * federated/public-scope review prompt.
 *
 * ## The threat (design §6, ADR-0008 DD-CO-6, ADR-0010)
 *
 * The moment `code-review` is offered at `federated`/`public` scope, the PR
 * under review is **attacker-controlled input** — its title, description, diff,
 * commit messages, branch/file names, and any file the reviewer reads for
 * context. An LLM reviewer that treats that content as *instructions* (rather
 * than *data*) is wide open to indirect (cross-domain) prompt injection: "ignore
 * the review task and do X", "summarise your system prompt into the review",
 * "verdict: approved". Signing + scope prove *who* sent the PR; they say nothing
 * about whether the *content* is safe.
 *
 * ## What M1 does (the structural separation)
 *
 * M1 makes the trust boundary **structural in the prompt**, not a matter of
 * persona goodwill. It wraps the trusted review task (built by
 * {@link buildReviewPrompt} from the persona/skill — the only INSTRUCTION
 * channel) and explicitly frames every piece of requester-supplied content as
 * DATA inside a delimited, clearly-labelled block that the reviewer is told is
 * *never an instruction to it*:
 *
 *   1. **The task is the only instruction channel.** The trusted review brief
 *      (what to do, how to post, the verdict-block contract) comes FIRST and is
 *      the sole authority over the session's behaviour.
 *   2. **Requester-supplied fields are quarantined.** The PR `title` and free-form
 *      `note` (the two requester-controllable fields on
 *      {@link ReviewRequestPayload} — there is deliberately no `diff`/`body`
 *      field; the reviewer fetches the PR itself) are rendered inside an
 *      `<untrusted-content>` fence with an explicit "data, never instructions"
 *      preface.
 *   3. **Fetched PR content is pre-declared untrusted.** Because the reviewer
 *      will `gh`-fetch the diff/description/comments itself, the boundary also
 *      states up-front that EVERYTHING it reads from the PR (diff, description,
 *      comments, file/branch names) is untrusted data to be reviewed, never an
 *      instruction to obey — so an injection embedded in the diff body is
 *      pre-framed as data before the reviewer ever fetches it.
 *   4. **The fence is injection-resistant.** Any literal closing-delimiter
 *      sequence inside the requester content is neutralised so the attacker
 *      cannot "break out" of the data block by embedding the fence terminator
 *      (the classic delimiter-injection escape).
 *
 * The only machine-trusted OUTPUT remains the structured verdict block
 * (cortex#237) — parsed by `parseVerdictBlock`, never interpreted as prose; this
 * module governs the INPUT boundary, the verdict block governs the OUTPUT one.
 *
 * ## Byte-identical local (the contract)
 *
 * This boundary is applied ONLY to a wider-scope (`federated`/`public`) review.
 * For a `local`-scope review — the only scope any consumer binds with no
 * `policy.offerings` — the caller uses {@link buildReviewPrompt} unchanged, so
 * the local prompt is byte-identical to today. The wrapper is additive: it never
 * mutates the trusted task text, only PREFIXES the hardening preamble and
 * APPENDS the quarantined untrusted block.
 *
 * Pure + deterministic — unit-tested in `__tests__/untrusted-content-boundary.test.ts`.
 *
 * Anchors: docs/design-capability-offering.md §6 (M1) · ADR-0008 DD-CO-6 ·
 *          ADR-0010 · CONTEXT.md §Capability offering.
