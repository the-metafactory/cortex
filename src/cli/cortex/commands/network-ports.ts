/**
 * S4 (Network Join Control Plane, #738 · epic #733 · spec
 * `docs/design-network-join-control-plane.md` §6 F4) — the injected-dependency
 * seams + the trust-boundary types for `cortex network join/leave/status`.
 *
 * ## Why ports
 *
 * `join` mutates the *live* deployment: it writes a nats-server leaf include
 * file, edits the launchd plist, rewrites a stack's federation config, and
 * restarts a daemon. None of that may run in a test (or accidentally during
 * development — CLAUDE.md / the S4 brief's SAFETY rule). So every side-effect
 * is a port: an interface the orchestrator (`network-lib.ts`) depends on, a
 * REAL adapter the CLI (`network.ts`) wires for production, and a FAKE the
 * tests assert against. The orchestrator itself is pure over its ports.
 *
 * ## The trust boundary — `VerifiedNetworkDescriptor` (S3-review N2)
 *
 * DD-9 requires that only a signature-verified descriptor reaches the leaf
 * renderer. S3 enforced that in PROSE. S4 makes it a TYPE: a
 * {@link VerifiedNetworkDescriptor} is a {@link NetworkDescriptor} branded with
 * a unique symbol that CANNOT be constructed outside this module. The only
 * mint is {@link brandVerified}, which this module calls EXCLUSIVELY from the
 * `NetworkRegistryPort.fetchVerified` success path (an `ok` result off S1's
 * pin+verify client). A descriptor that failed verification is a plain
 * `NetworkDescriptor` and is rejected by `tsc` at the `renderLeafInclude` call
 * site — the trust boundary is compiler-enforced, not reviewer-enforced.
