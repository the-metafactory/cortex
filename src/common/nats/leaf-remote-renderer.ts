/**
 * S3 (Network Join Control Plane, #737 / epic #733) — nats-server leaf-remote
 * renderer. Spec §6 F3; DD-6 (the runtime/arc owns the nats-server leaf
 * rendering); DD-12 (hub_url/leaf_port from the registry-served descriptor).
 *
 * ## What this is
 *
 * The pure config-producing half of "join". Given a verified
 * {@link NetworkDescriptor} (the registry's `GET /networks/{id}` payload —
 * `hub_url`/`leaf_port`, DD-12) plus the stack's local leaf binding (the
 * `.creds` path it authenticates the leaf with + the NATS account that leaf
 * traffic binds to in operator-mode), this renders the nats-server leaf
 * **remote** for that network. S4's `cortex network join` writes the output;
 * this module never touches a live `~/.config/nats/*.conf` or any daemon.
 *
 * ## Include-file vs in-place merge — the decision (and why)
 *
 * The live config (`~/.config/nats/local.conf`) is an **operator-mode**
 * config (NSC operator JWT + `resolver_preload` + `system_account`). Doing
 * HOCON text-surgery on it to splice a remote is fragile and irreversible.
 * Two options were on the table (per the S3 brief):
 *
 *   1. **`include` a per-network fragment.** nats-server's `include`
 *      directive splices the included file's tokens *at the point of
 *      inclusion* — it is NOT a deep map-merge. Two top-level `leafnodes {}`
 *      blocks do not concatenate their `remotes` arrays; the later block
 *      replaces the earlier. So an `include` of a standalone
 *      `leafnodes { remotes: [...] }` fragment would only work if the main
 *      config had **no** other `leafnodes` block — and splicing array
 *      *elements* requires editing the main config to add the include point
 *      inside the array. Both reintroduce live-config surgery.
 *
 *   2. **Structured merge with a per-network idempotency key.** Render each
 *      network's remote as a structured {@link LeafRemote} keyed by
 *      `network_id`, compose the full `remotes[]` deterministically via
 *      {@link mergeLeafRemotes} (re-render REPLACES by key, never
 *      duplicates), and emit a single self-describing include file
 *      (`leafnodes-<network>.conf`, {@link leafIncludeFileName}) that the
 *      runtime composes. Idempotent, reversible (S4 `leave` deletes the
 *      keyed entry / the file), multi-network-safe (OQ3: N keyed remotes),
 *      and it never edits the live operator-mode config in place.
 *
 * **We take option 2** — the brief's documented fallback — because NATS
 * `include` does not give us safe array-element merge, and a per-network
 * keyed structure is the only shape that is simultaneously idempotent,
 * reversible, and multi-network-clean. The renderer is pure; S4 owns the
 * single-writer step (which include file path, when to write, when to
 * reload).
 *
 * ## #717-aware (config-split)
 *
 * This renders the **nats-server** infrastructure config, which is a
 * SEPARATE artifact from the cortex per-stack config-split layout
 * (`~/.config/cortex/<stack>/<stack>.yaml`, migration 0003 / #717). It makes
 * NO assumption about a monolithic cortex config and reads no cortex.yaml —
 * the descriptor + binding are passed in. The include-file path is supplied
 * by the caller (S4), so the leaf config can live per-stack alongside the
 * split layout without this module hard-coding a monolith path.
 *
 * Vocabulary (CONTEXT.md): "network" = topology; "leaf"/"hub" = the NATS
 * leaf-node layer; "account" here is the NSC NATS account the leaf binds to
 * (the one place "operator-mode" legitimately refers to the NSC account-tree
 * root, never the principal).
