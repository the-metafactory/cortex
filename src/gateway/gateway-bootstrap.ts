/**
 * GW.a.3b.1 — flag-gated gateway bootstrap factory (cortex#524).
 *
 * Pure construction logic: reads the `CORTEX_GATEWAY` env flag, validates that
 * at least one surface binding exists, builds the binding index, and returns a
 * fully constructed (but not yet started) {@link SurfaceGateway}.
 *
 * ## Shadow stage (this slice)
 *
 * `maybeCreateSurfaceGateway` ALWAYS wires {@link LoggingInboundSink} as the
 * inbound sink — it logs the routing decision that WOULD be published to the
 * bus, but does NOT publish. This lets the gateway run alongside per-stack
 * adapters on a staging identity to prove demux correctness before any stack
 * loses its own adapter. The live bus-publishing sink flip is GW.a.3b.2.
 *
 * ## GW.a.3b.2 prerequisites (NOT done in this slice)
 *
 * 1. **cortex.ts boot wiring** — call `maybeCreateSurfaceGateway` after
 *    adapters are built, attach the returned gateway to the shutdown sequence
 *    (`await gw.start()` on startup; `await gw.stop()` on SIGTERM/SIGINT), and
 *    guard the whole block behind the same `enabled` flag.
 *
 * 2. **`LoadedConfig` must expose `Surfaces`** — today `foldSurfaceBindings`
 *    (`src/common/config/loader.ts:389`) folds surface bindings into the
 *    per-agent presence blocks and then DROPS the `surfaces:` key, so
 *    `LoadedConfig` does not retain the binding map. GW.a.3b.2 must either:
 *      (a) surface the validated `Surfaces` object on `LoadedConfig` (preferred
 *          — the gateway reads it from there), or
 *      (b) have the gateway read `surfaces.yaml` directly via a side-load.
 *    Option (a) is preferred; the fold already runs the schema validation, so
 *    the validated object is available at that point and can be returned
 *    alongside the existing `LoadedConfig` shape.
 *
 * 3. **Live staging adapters** — a throwaway gateway bot identity (cortex#562)
 *    with its own Discord/Slack application and bot token is needed to connect
 *    real platform adapters to the gateway during the shadow dry-run. These are
 *    injected via the `adapters` parameter; constructing them from a live config
 *    is GW.a.3b.2 work. **Precondition a.3b.2 must honour:** pass ≥1 adapter when
 *    bindings are present — this factory does not guard `adapters: []` (a gateway
 *    with bindings but no connections has nothing to receive on); a.3b.2 builds
 *    one adapter per `(platform, identity)` the gateway owns.
 *
 * ## Decision log (principal-locked 2026-06-02)
 *
 * - Env var name: `CORTEX_GATEWAY` (not `GATEWAY_ENABLED` — stays in the
 *   cortex namespace, consistent with `CORTEX_CHANNEL`, `CORTEX_AGENT_*`).
 * - Only `"1"` is truthy; `"true"`, `"yes"`, `"on"` are all false. Keeps the
 *   contract minimal and grep-stable.
 * - `isGatewayEnabled` is kept separate from the factory so flag-reading is
 *   independently testable without constructing anything.
 * - Empty-surfaces early-exit is a stderr warning (not a throw) because a
 *   misconfigured-but-flagged deployment should degrade gracefully — the rest
 *   of cortex starts normally, the gateway simply does not run.
