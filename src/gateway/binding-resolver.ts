/**
 * GW.a.1 — Gateway binding resolver (cortex#524).
 *
 * Pure, zero-I/O module that builds a fast lookup index from the validated
 * `Surfaces` config map and resolves an `InboundMessage` to the one binding
 * entry that should receive it.
 *
 * ## Real schema vs design §3.2 proposal
 *
 * `docs/design-shared-surface-gateway.md` §3.2 proposed a YAML shape with
 * per-channel `match` rules, explicit `instance` ids, and an `assistant`
 * field.  What CFG.c ACTUALLY shipped (see `src/common/types/surfaces.ts`) is
 * considerably flatter:
 *
 *   - Each platform key holds `Array<{ agent, stack?, binding }>`.
 *   - `binding` carries platform-credential fields only (`guildId` for Discord,
 *     `workspaceId` for Slack, `apiUrl`+`apiToken` for Mattermost).
 *   - There is NO per-channel `match` block, NO explicit `instance` id field,
 *     and NO `assistant` field on the binding.
 *
 * This resolver is grounded in the REAL shipped schema.
 *
 * ## Schema gaps surfaced (follow-ups)
 *
 * 1. **No per-channel `match`** — the real schema has no `match: { guildId,
 *    channelName }` block.  Demux is guild-granularity only (Discord guildId,
 *    Slack workspaceId).  Per-channel routing within a guild is deferred.
 *
 * 2. **No explicit `instance` id** — `surfaces.yaml` carries no stable
 *    `instance` field (the §3.2 proposal had one).  This resolver derives an
 *    INTERIM id as `"${platform}:${demuxKey}"` (see `GatewayBindingMatch.instance`
 *    below).  When the schema grows an explicit field this derivation should be
 *    replaced.  Tracked: design §3.3 / OQ4.
 *
 * 3. **`assistant` not on the binding** — the GW needs to know which assistant
 *    a binding targets so it can build a Direct dispatch subject
 *    (`tasks.@{did-encoded-assistant}.chat`).  The real schema only carries
 *    `agent` (the stack-local agent id, the fold-join key against `agents[].id`).
 *    Agent → assistant resolution is deferred to the stack config lookup that
 *    the caller performs after resolving the binding.
 *
 * 4. **`stack` is optional** — the binding's `stack: "{principal}/{stack}"` field
 *    is optional.  When absent, `principal` and `stack` on the returned match
 *    are `undefined`.  The caller must handle the absent-stack case (e.g.
 *    by falling back to the stack the GW itself runs as).
 *
 * ## v1 decisions baked in
 *
 * - **Connection dedup / demux key = `(platform, guildId|workspaceId)`** —
 *   OQ1 option (a): operational truth as of today.
 * - **Single-principal v1** — cross-principal (`federated.`) bindings are out
 *   of scope.  OQ3 deferred.
 * - **Read from the validated `Surfaces` type** (composed config, not a
 *   separate raw file).  OQ7 → composed.
 * - **Mattermost has no per-message server id** on `InboundMessage`: if exactly
 *   one Mattermost binding exists in the config, it is the single-binding
 *   fallback and is used unconditionally; if more than one binding exists the
 *   inbound cannot be demuxed, and `resolveBinding` returns `null` with the
 *   ambiguity recorded in the index.

 * bound stack's OWN runner republishes `dispatch.task.*` on
 * `local.{principal}.{stack}.dispatch.task.>`, stamping its own runtime
 * principal (which EQUALS the gateway principal under single-principal v1 — the
 * gateway is a separate process and does not stamp the reply) and its stack
 * leaf. A stack whose subject the sink never subscribes to would have its
 * replies silently dropped.
 *
 * Returns one entry per DISTINCT parsed `stack` leaf (re-using `parseStack`,
 * the single source of `{principal}/{stack}` parsing — no drift). A gap-4
 * binding (no `stack` field, §4 above) yields a single `undefined` entry,
 * which the sink turns into the 5-segment legacy subject
 * `local.{principal}.dispatch.task.>` — the shape such a binding publishes on.
 *
 * Single-principal v1 (§ "v1 decisions" above): the principal segment is the

 * dispatch sink key off the gateway's OWN principal and discard each binding's
 * parsed principal. That makes the single-principal rule an *assumption*. A
 * binding that declared `{otherPrincipal}/{stack}` would then be silently
 * absorbed into the gateway principal's namespace on both legs — the exact
 * latent cross-principal leak single-principal v1 is meant to exclude.
 *
 * This helper turns the assumption into an enforceable gate: the caller throws
 * a loud boot error when the result is non-empty (same loud-validation style as
 * {@link buildBindingIndex}'s duplicate-key throw), so a cross-principal
 * misconfig fails at startup rather than mis-routing at runtime. Bindings with
 * no `stack` field (gap-4) carry no principal and are never flagged.
 *
 * Returns the offending raw `stack` values (deduped, in iteration order) so the
